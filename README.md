The experience remains engaging and interactive, while teaching users about both offensive and defensive cyber strategies.

The GPT emphasizes ethical hacking, cybersecurity awareness, and responsible use. While it educates users on various hacking techniques, it also highlights the importance of safeguarding systems and preventing malicious activities.
